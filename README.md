Rapid and reliable software development and deployment processes for everyone: developers, sysadmins, and designers.

That app ain't gonna run itself.
--------------------------------

What happens when you're developing an web app locally and you run `python app.py` or `node index.js`? If conditions are right, the app spins up and you can examine your output via localhost on a port of your choosing. But how does that app get to YourCompanysWebsite.com? 

DevOps is a movement to take these deployment concerns into consideration. When everyone thinks about this, the team writes better software faster. It is the front-end, back-end, and sysadmins [working together to share troubleshooting information across  their silos](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/what-exactly-is-devops/240009147).

Basics
==========

Machine: You need an operating system
-------------------------------------

Linux boxes and Vagrant

Provisioning: That operating system needs software to run your program
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Shell Scripts, Ansible

Deployment: Your app needs to live in a publicly accessible machine
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the cloud

nginx, Apache

Do It Again and Again and Again
==============================
